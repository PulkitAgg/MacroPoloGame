Simple game in which childres are sit around in a circle and count the numbers from 1 to 100. However, every time the number that a child is supposed to say is divisible by 4, the child says 'marco' instead of the number. Every time the number is divisible by 7, the child says 'polo' instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 4 and 7, the child will say 'marcopolo'.
